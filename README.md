## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs text classification on consumer complaint data using machine learning.  
The complaints are classified into the following categories:

| Label | Category           |
|-------|--------------------|
| 0     | Credit Reporting   |
| 1     | Debt Collection    |
| 2     | Consumer Loan      |
| 3     | Mortgage           |

### Key Features:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- TF-IDF feature extraction  
- Multi-class classification using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes  
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix  
- Visualizations: class distribution, word clouds
